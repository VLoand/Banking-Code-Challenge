# Banking-Code-Challenge
A Java Coding Challenge to create a Banking console app

This Java console application provides a simple bank system where users can create accounts, perform transactions, and view account details.

To use this console application it is neccesary to download the java files above (Account.java Transaction.java Bank.java BankSystem.java) and compile them using the command:
javac Account.java Transaction.java Bank.java BankSystem.java

After that, you can run:
java BankSystem

And following the prompts that are on screen to navigate the menu interface, you should be able to:
- Create accounts
- Perform transactions (flat fee or percentage fee)
- Withdraw and deposit money
- View account transactions
- Check account balances
- List all accounts
- View total transaction fee amount
- View total transfer amount

  ## Files

The application consists of the following Java files:

- `Account.java`: Defines the Account class with properties and methods for managing user accounts.
- `Transaction.java`: Defines the Transaction class and its subclasses for representing transactions.
- `Bank.java`: Defines the Bank class with methods for managing accounts and transactions.
- `BankSystem.java`: Contains the main method to run the bank system application.

  N.B.

You will also find 3 Unit Tests and one Integration Test uploaded on this repo.
